Welcome to Flaskâ€™s documentation. Get started with Installation and then get an overview with the Quickstart.
There is also a more detailed Tutorial that shows how to create a small but complete application with Flask. 
Common patterns are described in the Patterns for Flask section. 
The rest of the docs describe each component of Flask in detail,
 with a full reference in the API section.
